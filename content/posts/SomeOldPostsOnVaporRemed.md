## VaporRemed Case Studies

### A site in Virginia

 - A site in Virginia, one of our initial projects - circa 2006.

#### Some quotes and figures from the report

    The application of AgroRemed appears to have reduced the levels of
    dissolved phase contamination in the groundwater and increased
    dispersion of the free product, resulting in an increase in the amount
    of free product in MW-4. Recovery of the free product utilizing
    aggressive fluid vapor recovery (AFVR) appears to be effective;
    therefore, its continued use is recommended.

    In-Situ Bioremediation was requested by the DEQ, as a cost effective
    method of remediation at this site. A product known as AgroRemed Â® was
    chosen, because of its ability to address all phases of petroleum
    contamination using a single application.
