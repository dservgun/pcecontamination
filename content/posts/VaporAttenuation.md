## Vapor Attenuation of paired PCE values between Indoor Air (IA-001) and Sub-Slab area (VP-003)

The plot below shows the VaporAttenuation factor based on the formula below for PCE values.

### Notes

We present vapor attenuation as a function of time to understand the impact of VaporRemed during the remediation process. Vapor attenuation (Johnson and Ettinger 1991) refers to the reduction in concentration of vapor-forming chemicals that occurs during vapor migration in the subsurface, coupled with the dilution that can occur when the vapors enter a building and mix with indoor. Our treatment of the data is presented for understanding the ratio based on the data collected, rather than as a tool to model vapor intrusion at the site.
