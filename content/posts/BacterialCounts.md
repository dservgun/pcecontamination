## Bacterial counts at VP-003.

In order to determine whether the chlorine released during the bio-remediation of TCE/PCE is a limiting factor, we measured the bacterial counts at two points seperated by 70 hours.

The sustained population count indicates that any toxicity due to bio-remediation of PCE and TCE, such as increase in chlorine levels at VP-003 are not having an impact to the bacterial population in VaporRemed. This observation is significant as it presents a clear evidence of bio-remediation taking place; an observation that is further backed by the reduction in contamination levels is indoor air and sub slab areas.
