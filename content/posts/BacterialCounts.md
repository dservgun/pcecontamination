## Bacterial counts at VP-003.

In order to determine whether Chlorine released during the bio-remediation of TCE/PCE is a limiting factor, we measured the bacterial counts at two points seperated by 70 hours.

  - 3/23/2020 - 14, 800, 000 CFU/ml
    - ![Bacterial count on March 23rd](/img/BacterialCount-03-23-2020.png)

  - 3/25/2020 - 15, 300, 000 CFU/ml

The sustained population count indicates that increase in levels of Chlorine due to bio-remediation of PCE and TCE are not impacting the bacterial population in VaporRemed. This observation presents a clear evidence of bio-remediation taking place; an observation that is further backed by the reduction in contamination levels is indoor air and sub slab areas.

### Terms and definitions

#### CFU/ml (Colony Forming Unit)
  Number of colony forming units per ML. A colony forming unit is a unit used in microbiology to estimate the number of viable *bacteria* or *fungi* cells in a sample.
