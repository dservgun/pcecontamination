## Mission statement

### Our mission is to help cleanup the mess created by fossil-fuels and dry-cleaning solvents such as Trichloroethylene (TCE) and Perchloroethylene (PCE).

There are a number of sites all-over the world that have been abandoned, if the real-estate pressure allows them to be abandoned, or are being inhabited by a population that does not have a suitable housing options. As a side note, the options are not necessarily financial, though they do form a component. Back to the mission statement: current cleanup methods are quite cumbersome and outright expensive. We don't really have to look far to see the exposure sites contaminated with dry-cleaning contaminants have for the property owners (here we should not lose sight of the fact that DOD used to be one of the biggest consumers of PCE/TCE, followed by the semi-conductor industry). These cleanup operations cost quite a bit, therefore, usually, results in either the taxpayer saddled with the bill for cleanup with or without CERCLA. 


### Narrower vision

I believe in starting small. Therefore, our approach has been to fix one acre of contaminated land at a time, because, the size of this problem is quite vast and overwhelming to me. Also, it is simpler to measure success this way. Most of the projects listed on this site are projects that we have worked on or working on.

#### Dry-cleaning contaminants

We all can agree with the fact that this problem is vast and creative solutions need the entire community to come together to help cleanup the soil, water and air of these contaminants to reduce the risk of exposure to cancer among our population. Compounds such as TCE/PCE were designed to be stable therefore are hard to breakdown making them harmful to general biotic life. For now, I am focusing on the impact of TCE/PCE to human exposure based on the recent findings by the USEPA about the threats posed by exposure to PCE and TCE in these posts. 

#### Hydrocarbon contaminants

There are many abandoned gas stations in the country that can be re-purposed to re-vitalize a neighborhood. Our goal is to clean-up one abandoned gas-station at a time. A project that I am currently working on is ![here](/img/abandoned_gas_station_1.png). I will talk more about these kinds of projects in subsequent posts.



### The posts, their content

A note about the posts. We are trying to put together all the data in byte-sized format so that, firstly, I can understand the data better and thereby help my readers understand my goals and clarify any questions that will follow. Please watch this space, as we will be trying to present most of the work we have done over the past couple of decades here.
