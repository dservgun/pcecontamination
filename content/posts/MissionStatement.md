## Mission statement

### Our mission is to help cleanup the mess created by fossil-fuels and dry-cleaning solvents such as Trichloroethylene (TCE), Perchloroethylene (PCE) and oil.

Our mission is to cleanup of sites contaminated with dry cleaning chemicals such as  PCE/TCE and also fuel oil releases in the environment effectively through aerobic bioremediation. Current cleanup methods are quite cumbersome and very expensive as they involve invasive process of excavation and disposal. Our goal is to reduce the time of cleanup and reduce the cost.

### Narrower vision

I believe in starting *small* . Our approach, therefore, has been to fix *one acre* of contaminated land at a time. It is simpler to measure success. Most of the projects listed on this site are projects that we have worked on or working on.

#### Cleanup of sites contaminated with Dry-cleaning compounds such as TCE/PCE

Compounds such as TCE/PCE were designed to be stable therefore are hard to breakdown making them harmful to general biotic life. Bio-remediation of TCE/PCE has been extensively studied in *anaerobic* conditions and the results are not as encouraging as one would have liked. In these posts we present data collected on *aerobic* bio-remediation of TCE/PCE using [VaporRemed](https://www.epa.gov/emergency-response/spillremed-mariner). We are working on this site actively:

Exposure to unsafe levels of TCE/PCE can happen anywhere and most likely caused by contamination caused by operations that have ceased decades ago; the dry-cleaning store was closed way back in the 80s. In the data we have collected, we are showing that *VaporRemed* is able to accomplish bio-remediation with hours and weeks. This data has significant import for many bio-remediation projects that are still making progress at a much slower rate: 
  > VaporRemed can be used as an effective Vapor Intrusion Control system.
We are still working on an acronym thats as catchy as a Soil Vapor Extraction (SVE) unit, though much much cheaper.


#### Abandoned gas stations

There are many abandoned gas stations in the country that can be re-purposed to re-vitalize a neighborhood. Our goal is to clean-up one abandoned gas-station at a time. A project that I am currently working on is shown below:

We will present some recent and not-so-recent projects.
