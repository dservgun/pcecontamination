## Update on the levels of PCE/TCE in Indoor Air (IA-001), SG-101 and SG-106

The current post presents the latest data recorded in indoor air in one of the *hotspots*, namely *IA-001* in May 2020.

  - IA-001

##### Note

The increase in levels of 1,2-cisDCE and VinylChloride (VC) are indicative or bio-remediation of solvents accomplished by VaporRemed.

### TCE levels at IA-001
  - IA-001

  - SG-106

  - SG-101

    Even though we see a slight uptick, the numbers are still within the site-specific limits.

The TCE levels are below the required site specific limits during the entire six-month period starting from Dec 2019. As a side note, the last time [VaporRemed](https://www.epa.gov/emergency-response/spillremed-mariner) was added to the site was in the third week of March, 2020.
