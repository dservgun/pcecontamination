### Total amount of VaporRemed added to Soil - 41 gallons.
### Total amount of VaporRemed added to Sub-slab area - 142 + 91 = 233 gallons.
### Total amount of VaporRemed added to SG-101 - 35 gallons
### Total amount of VaporRemed added to SG-106 - 100 gallons.


### Grand total amount of VaporRemed added to the site is - 476 gallons.



### Comparison with other projects

Although to do an apples-to-apples comparison is not accurate, the following paragraph from the 
*Fourth Five-Year Review Report for Middlefield-Ellis-Whisman (MEW) Superfund Study Area (Pg. 21)* is quite instructive of the amount of engineering effort needed to accomplish bio-remediation on the field.

Several in-situ treatment pilot programs have been implemented to target high TCE concentration areas to
more efficiently reduce TCE concentrations. Intel injected 46,000 gallons of emulsified soybean oil into
the groundwater in 2014 at 365 and 401 E. Middlefield Road; subsequent monitoring results indicate
decreasing concentrations of TCE, and in some wells, the production of ethane, which indicates complete
dechlorination. Schlumberger is conducting an in-situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) pilot treatability study
at the former 401 National Avenue property (now 600 National Avenue). Since 2015, Schlumberger has
completed seven events injecting sodium permanganate and sodium persulfate oxidants. In 2019, SMI
implemented an abiotic reductive dechlorination pilot treatability study using sulfidated zero valent iron
at the 455 and 485/487 E. Middlefield Road properties.

Our approach to bio-remediation has been to add *only* as much of VaporRemed as needed for the project. There are a couple of technical reasons as to why we are able to accomplish such economies of scale while performing better than most alternative bioremediation solutions in the marketplace : either commercial, off-the-shelf products or make-shift bioremediation alternatives as outlined below. We will try to address them in a separate blog if the reader is interested.
