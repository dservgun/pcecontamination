## First-order decay curves at SG-106

### Here we focus on the project period between 12/4/2019 - 12/14/2019.

The image shown below for the degradation of TCE/PCE levels after adding VaporRemed on 12/4/2019.

These numbers allowed us to extrapolate a decay model for TCE based on the PCE data (an approximate second-order derivative). The image shown below shows an increase in TCE before falling off to a straight-line first-order decay.

The curve shown above clearly indicates that TCE levels increase before they decrease. This observation is inline with most literature on bio-remediation of chlorinated solvents.
